Project #3: MEAN Web Application
================================

We're almost at the end of the journey.
In our time together,
we've looked at tons of different programming concepts and techniques.
This is where you get to show it all off.

Your 3rd and final project
will be a **single-page Web application** using the **MEAN stack**.

Like the other projects, **this project is to be done individually**.

Looking for Project #1 or #2? See the [Project #1 document](project-1.md) or the [Project #2 document](project-2.md).

Schedule
--------

### Tuesday - October 10th ###
- **3:00 p.m.** - _Presentation Rehearsal #1_: About You & Your Project <br>
  For your first presentation rehearsal
  you should create your initial presentation
  as a short, 1-2 minute set of slides.
  Your slides only need to talk about **you and your project idea**.

### Wednesday - October 11th ###
- **3:00 p.m.** - _Presentation Rehearsal #2_: Slides With Structure <br>
  For the second presentation rehearsal
  you should change your short presentation into its final, 3 minute form.
  Your slides will have more structure and more content.

### Thursday - October 12th ###
- **3:00 p.m.** - _Presentation Rehearsal #3_: Demo <br>
  For the third presentation rehearsal
  you should incorporate a demo of your live application at the end of your talk.
  Your presentation structure should be more or less the same,
  but you should make adjustments based on feedback from the previous day.

### Friday - October 13th ###
- **2:00 p.m.** - **Hackshow: Project #3 Presentations** <br>
  Finally, on Friday it's time for your **last Ironhack project presentation**.
  You will present your projects to senior dev judges, staff and other students.
  Remember to dress at least one degree nicer than normal.

After the presentations, we will have **Graduation** and **Happy Hour**!


Updated Technical Requirements
------------------------------

You app must:

1. **Use Angular** for all of the user-facing parts of your application.
2. **Use Express** for your **API backend**
   that your Angular app will communicate with.
3. **Use Mongoose** for models and database communication.
4. **Have 3 models _or more_**.
   Having one for users is a no-brainer.
   The other two should represent the main functionality of your app.
   Don't force it if having a 3rd model doesn't make sense.
5. **Have validation on its models** with feedback for users
   if their submission is invalid.
6. **Include sign up, log in & log out functionality**
   with encrypted passwords (or social logins)
   and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
7. **Have _two_ repos on GitHub**.
   One for your Angular application and the other for your Express API backend.
8. Have at least **1 commit per day** that you worked on it.
9. **Be deployed online** using Heroku, so anybody could use your app.
10. **Be connected to your free .co domain**.
    Ironhack will send you an email with your promo code
    and instructions on how to redeem it for your free .co domain.

Responsive design **is not a requirement**. <br>
Wireframes **are not a requirement**. <br>
Full CRUD **is not a requirement**.


Updated Deliverables
--------------------

- A **working MEAN stack application, built by you** that runs on a server.
- A **deploy of your app** on Heroku with a .co domain.
- The **two URLs** of your **GitHub repositories** (Angular & Express).
- The URL of the **live app on your .co domain**.
- The URL of the **Heroku app**.
- The URL of the **slides for your app's presentation**.
- Your **GitHub repos** should have
  the **URL of your live app** in the URL section.
- You must present your app during Project #3 final presentations
  (last day of Project #3 time).

Wireframes **are not a deliverable**. <br>
User stories **are not a deliverable**.


Grading Criteria (same as on platform)
--------------------------------------
- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

- **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something engaging and playable to the end user?

- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming?

- **Deployment**: Did you deploy your application to a public URL using GitHub Pages?

- **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | Does not meet expectations.
**1** | Meets expectations. Good job!
**2** | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!

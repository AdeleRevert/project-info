        The world is destined for ruins and you are our only hope. Indeed, every hoomans became sexists in this
        patriarchal world. Thanks for us, the Divine Animals are strong and fierce feminists. But as big their idea can
        be, their little teacup size put them in danger in face of these ugly disgusting misogynist hoomans. <br>
        Please help us... You are a sexy-af-badass-hella-hot unicorn. Please skewer those villain hoomans with your
        majestic horn but be careful, you mustn't touch the dignified Divine Animals. </p>

        You have to eliminate X hoomans to save the Divines aka save the world. But be careful, if you skewer one of
        those cute little angels, you lose. </p>
